   It will see "Your project references the latest version of Entity Framework; however, an Entity Framework database provider compatible with
   this version could not be found for your data connection. If you have already installed a compatible provider, ensure you have rebuilt your project
   before performing this action. Otherwise, exit this wizard, install a compatible provider, and rebuild your project before performing this action" exception.

   Possible Workarounds:
   i) Move the EF model into its own project that compiles as Any CPU, then add that project as a dependency of the x64 (64-bit) StartUp project.
  ii) Target the application to Any CPU platform.
